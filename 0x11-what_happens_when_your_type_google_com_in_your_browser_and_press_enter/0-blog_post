When you type www.google.com in your browser and hit enter, the following happens:

DNS request: Your computer sends a request to the DNS server to resolve the domain name www.google.com into an IP address.
TCP/IP: Once the IP address is resolved, your computer establishes a TCP/IP connection with the server at that IP address.
Firewall: The firewall checks if the request is legitimate and allows it to pass through if it is.
HTTPS/SSL: If you are using HTTPS (which is the case for Google), your computer and the server establish an encrypted connection using SSL/TLS.
Load-balancer: The request is then sent to a load balancer which distributes the traffic across multiple web servers.
Web server: The web server receives the request and sends back an HTML page as a response.
Application server: The HTML page may contain dynamic content that needs to be generated by an application server. The application server generates this content and sends it back to the web server.
Database: The application server may need to access a database to generate the dynamic content. It sends a query to the database and receives the results.
